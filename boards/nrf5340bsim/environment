# TODO: So almost sysbuild working BUT the EXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE is passing everywhere. We are trying
# to figure out how to best pass the overlays and conf files without this environment file at all hopefully.
# Q: Is it possible to include prj.conf files from application?
# Q: Is it possible to add the shared repository into some list such that the application could include overlays easily?
#    e.g #include <shared/nrf54l15_common.overlay>, then can include that directly in application codes
# Overall we want to avoid having to pass the EXTRA vars as the BOARD var should be enough for the app to include everything.
